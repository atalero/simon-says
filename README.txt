A Pen created at CodePen.io. Play my game at https://codepen.io/atalero/pen/prQrLg. 

All visuals and functionality 100% coded and designed by me.

**Free Code Camp Project**
 
Last project in Free Code Camp. This Simon Game uses an array to keep track of the computer’s random moves and monitor the player’s moves. I used jQuery events to program buttons and game options.
